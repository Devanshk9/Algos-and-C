# Algos-and-C
This repository serves as a collection of algorithms and C++ concepts that I am learning and implementing for future reference. It includes various algorithms like sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and data structures, along with core C++ concepts such as OOP, STL, pointers, and memory management.

The goal is to use this as a personal resource to reinforce my understanding of C++ and algorithms while preparing for competitive programming, interviews, and academic projects.
